# Odin project, recursion project

The fibonacci there's two algorithm a iterating version and a recursion version both
of them runs on O(n) time complexity and O(n) memory.

The merge sort solution uses a recursion approach. It uses the idea of divide and conquer.
It runs on O(n log n) time and O(n) space complexity.

To test this project do these steps:

-   Clone the repository.
-   Have nodejs installed.
-   run `npm install`.
-   run `npm run test`.
